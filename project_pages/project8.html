    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      This project involves using Python to scrape real-time cryptocurrency
      price data from online sources. By leveraging web scraping libraries
      such as BeautifulSoup and requests, the application extracts price
      information for multiple cryptocurrencies and stores the data in a
      structured format, allowing users to track and analyze cryptocurrency
      prices efficiently.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      <li>
        Data Collection: To gather real-time price data for various
        cryptocurrencies from selected online sources using web scraping
        techniques.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data Structuring: To organize and format the collected data into a
        structured format, such as a CSV file, for easy access and analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data Accuracy: To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the scraped
        data by validating against known price points.
      </li>
      <li>
        Automation: To create a script that can be run periodically to update
        the price data automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scalability: To design the solution in a way that allows for the
        addition of new cryptocurrencies or data sources with minimal changes
        to the code.
      </li>

      <br />
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Scope</strong></h2>
    <p>
    <ol>

      <li>Identifying relevant web sources for cryptocurrency prices.</li>
      <li>Implementing web scraping techniques to extract price data.</li>
      <li>
        Structuring and storing the extracted data for further analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensuring the solution handles dynamic content and web page structure
        changes.
      </li>
      </p>
    </ol>


    <br />

    <h2>Data Reference</h2>
    <p>The data source for this project is the
      <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/crypto/all/">Yahoo Finance Cryptocurrency</a> page. This page provides
      comprehensive information on various cryptocurrencies, including real-time price data, market capitalization,
      trading volume, and historical performance.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The project successfully demonstrated the capability of Python to
      automate the extraction of real-time cryptocurrency price data from online sources. By leveraging libraries such
      as requests and BeautifulSoup, the project achieved:

      <li>Effective Data Collection: Real-time price data for various cryptocurrencies was successfully scraped and
        collected.
      <li> Structured Data Storage: Data was organized and saved in a CSV format, facilitating easy access and analysis.
      </li>
      <li> Accuracy and Reliability: The data collection process was validated for accuracy, ensuring the reliability of
        the information.</li>
      <li> Automation: The solution included an automated process for periodic updates, ensuring that the data remains
        current.</li> <br>
      Future enhancements could include expanding the range of data sources, incorporating additional data points
      (e.g., historical prices), and improving the scalability of the solution to handle a larger volume of data.
