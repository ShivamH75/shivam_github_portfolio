  <!-- // Add Project Details Here  -->
  <section class="projectDetails">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data. The
      dataset includes detailed information on electric vehicles, such as their location, make, model, type, and various
      other attributes. The dashboard will provide insights into the distribution, characteristics, and trends of
      electric vehicles across different counties and cities.</p>


    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The data for this project is sourced from Kaggle <a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population" target="_blank">(Ref. dataset)</a>.</p>

    <!-- <h2>SQL Analysis Questions </h2>
            <ol>
            1. What is the average pollutant level (pollutant_avg) for each pollutant type across all cities? <br>
            2. Which city has the highest average pollutant level for PM10? <br>
            3. Which city has the highest average pollutant level for PM10 and PM2.5 combined?</p> </ol>
            <h2>Insights and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                The analysis will provide valuable insights into the air quality situation across different regions. Key findings will highlight areas with the highest pollution levels, identify trends over time, and uncover significant differences between pollutant types and their impacts. These insights can inform public health recommendations, policy decisions, and environmental initiatives aimed at improving air quality.
            </p> -->
