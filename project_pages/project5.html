    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <!-- <p>The objective of this project is to analyze defect data to identify trends, understand defect distribution, and assess the effectiveness of inspection methods. By visualizing this data, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help improve product quality and reduce defect-related costs.</p> -->


    <!-- <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The data for this project is sourced from Kaggle <a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahmidachowdhury/manufacturing-defects">(Ref. dataset)</a>.</p>
        <p>The dataset contains the following columns:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Sr. No.</th>
        <th>Entity</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1. </td>
        <td>defect_id</td>
        <td>Unique identifier for each defect.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. </td>
        <td>product_id</td>
        <td>Identifier for the product associated with the defect.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. </td>
        <td>defect_type</td>
        <td>Type of defect (e.g., Structural, Functional, Cosmetic).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. </td>
        <td>defect_date</td>
        <td>Date when the defect was recorded.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5. </td>

    <h2>Initial Analysis</h2>
    <p>
Based on the dataset, we can perform the following analyses:

Defect Distribution by Type: Analyze the distribution of different types of defects.
Defect Severity Analysis: Analyze the severity levels of the defects.
Defect Location Analysis: Analyze where defects are commonly found.
Inspection Method Effectiveness: Compare the effectiveness of different inspection methods.
Repair Cost Analysis: Analyze the repair costs associated with different defects.
Trend Analysis: Analyze the trends over time for defect occurrences.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Expected Outcomes
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced Understanding of Defects: Visualizing defect distribution by type and location helps in understanding the most common and problematic defects, allowing targeted improvements in quality control processes.</li> <br>
      <li>Prioritization of Critical Issues: Severity analysis enables prioritizing efforts on the most critical defects that have a significant impact on product performance and customer satisfaction.</li> <br>
      <li>Optimization of Inspection Methods: Assessing the effectiveness of different inspection methods provides insights into which methods are most efficient and cost-effective, leading to better resource allocation.</li><br>
      <li>Cost Management: Analysis of repair costs helps in budgeting and managing expenses related to defect repairs, identifying areas where cost-saving measures can be implemented.</li> <br>
      <li>Trend Insights:Understanding trends in defect occurrences and repair costs over time allows for proactive measures to be taken, preventing future defects and managing costs more effectively.</li>
    </ul>
