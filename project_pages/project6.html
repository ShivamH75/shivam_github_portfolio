      <h2>Project Background</h2>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis
        using SQL queries, entirely conducted within Jupyter Notebooks. A unique
        aspect of this project is the absence of traditional DBMS software such
        as MySQL Workbench or PostgreSQL. Instead, utilized the SQLite module in
        Python to create and manage the database, tables, and schema directly
        within the notebook environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project showcases the seamless integration of Python and SQL, where
        Python’s powerful Pandas library is leveraged for handling dataframes
        and importing CSV files into database tables. This approach not only
        simplifies the workflow but also enhances flexibility, making it easier
        to analyze and manipulate data all in one place.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2>Objectives:</h2>
      <p>
        <li>
          Conduct a thorough analysis of pizza shop sales data by formulating
          and answering key business questions using SQL queries. This will
          provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product
          performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Revisit and reinforce fundamental SQL concepts by applying them in
          real-world scenarios, ensuring a strong foundation in query writing
          and data manipulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explore and implement advanced SQL concepts, including nested queries
          and window functions, to perform complex data analysis and gain deeper
          insights from the dataset.
        </li>

        <br />

      <h2><strong>Scope of the Project:</strong></h2>
      <p>
        This project involves a comprehensive exploration of data analysis
        techniques using SQL within a Python environment. The key steps and
        components of the project include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Library Importation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Import essential Python libraries such as sqlite3 for database
              management, pandas for data manipulation, and ipython-sql to
              facilitate SQL execution directly within Jupyter Notebooks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure the environment is set up to allow seamless integration of
              SQL and Python code, enabling efficient data handling and
              analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Database Creation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Establish a new SQLite database file within the Jupyter Notebook
              environment. The database is created programmatically using
              Python’s SQLite module, eliminating the need for external DBMS
              software like MySQL Workbench or PostgreSQL.
            </li>
            <li>
              Define the database structure to ensure it aligns with the
              project’s data analysis requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Table Creation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Design and create multiple tables within the SQLite database
              according to the project's data schema. Each table is carefully
              structured to store relevant data points, ensuring data integrity
              and accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include tables for various entities (e.g., orders, customers,
              products) with primary keys, foreign keys, and appropriate data
              types.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Importation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Load data into the SQLite tables from external CSV files using
              Python’s Pandas library. This involves reading the CSV files into
              Pandas DataFrames and then transferring the data into the database
              tables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that the imported data adheres to the predefined schema and
              that there is no overwriting of existing table structures.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SQL Query Execution:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Execute a series of SQL queries within the Jupyter Notebook to
              analyze the data stored in the SQLite database. This includes both
              basic queries to retrieve specific data and advanced queries
              involving nested queries and window functions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Address specific business questions related to pizza shop sales,
              using SQL to extract meaningful insights and trends from the data.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Analysis:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Perform a detailed analysis of the query results to draw
              actionable insights.
            </li>
            <li>
              Document findings and present them in a clear and concise manner,
              supported by data visualizations and summaries where appropriate
              (To be added).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
