    <p>
      MilkSetGo is a digital platform conceptualized to bridge the gap between local dairy farmers and large-scale milk
      buyers such as processing companies, cooperatives, and urban distributors. This application aims to eliminate
      intermediaries, increase transparency in pricing, and offer a direct marketplace for rural milk producers to sell
      their milk efficiently and profitably.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a Business Analyst and Product Manager, the goal of this project was to identify operational challenges in the
      traditional dairy supply chain, understand the needs of both farmers and buyers, and design a user-friendly,
      scalable application that addresses these pain points.
      <br>
      <br>
      The project involved end-to-end analysis from market research to feature planning, followed by functional
      documentation, MVP scoping, and proposing a sustainable go-to-market strategy. The platform not only focuses on
      milk transactions but also offers support features such as pickup scheduling, payment tracking, group selling
      options, and dispute resolution â€” tailored for the unique context of rural India.
      <br>
      <br>
      MilkSetGo envisions empowering farmers through digital inclusion, offering them better income visibility, improved
      planning, and stronger negotiation power.
