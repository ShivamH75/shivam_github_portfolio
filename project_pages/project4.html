    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data. The
      dataset includes detailed information on electric vehicles, such as their location, make, model, type, and various
      other attributes. The dashboard will provide insights into the distribution, characteristics, and trends of
      electric vehicles across different counties and cities.</p>


    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The data for this project is sourced from Kaggle <a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population">(Ref. dataset)</a>.</p>
        <p>The dataset contains the following columns:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Sr. No.</th>
        <th>Entity</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1. </td>
        <td>defect_id</td>
        <td>Unique identifier for each defect.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. </td>
        <td>product_id</td>
        <td>Identifier for the product associated with the defect.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. </td>
        <td>defect_type</td>
        <td>Type of defect (e.g., Structural, Functional, Cosmetic).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. </td>
        <td>defect_date</td>
        <td>Date when the defect was recorded.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5. </td>
        <td>defect_location</td>
        <td>Location of the defect (e.g., Component, Internal, Surface).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6. </td>
        <td>severity</td>
        <td>Severity level of the defect (e.g., Minor, Moderate, Critical).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7. </td>
        <td>inspection_method</td>
        <td>Method used to inspect the defect (e.g., Visual Inspection, Automated Testing, Manual Testing).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>8. </td>
        <td>Model</td>
        <td>The specific model of the vehicle</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9. </td>
        <td>repair_cost</td>
        <td>Cost to repair the defect.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <h2>Initial Analysis</h2>
    <p>
Based on the dataset, we can perform the following analyses:

Defect Distribution by Type: Analyze the distribution of different types of defects.
Defect Severity Analysis: Analyze the severity levels of the defects.
Defect Location Analysis: Analyze where defects are commonly found.
Inspection Method Effectiveness: Compare the effectiveness of different inspection methods.
Repair Cost Analysis: Analyze the repair costs associated with different defects.
Trend Analysis: Analyze the trends over time for defect occurrences.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Expected Outcomes
    </h2>
